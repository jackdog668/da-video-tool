# Video Lab — Skool Drop Kit

Everything you need to ship `Video Lab` to your Skool community in one paste.

---

## 1. Announcement post (paste in Skool)

> **NEW DROP: Video Lab v0.1.0**
>
> Paste any video link. Get the file. No browser ads, no sketchy sites, no "convert to MP3" pop-ups.
>
> **What it does:**
> • Downloads from YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram, Twitch, and 1000+ other sites (anywhere yt-dlp works)
> • MP4 video up to 4K, or rip the audio as MP3
> • Playlist mode → pick which videos you want with checkboxes
> • Subtitles + thumbnails embedded automatically (optional toggles)
> • Sequential queue so you can fire off 20 downloads and walk away
>
> **Install:** download the `Video Lab_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` below → double-click → next next finish → done. Nothing else needed (yt-dlp + ffmpeg are bundled inside).
>
> **First time you run it:** Windows SmartScreen might warn "Unrecognized app" because I haven't paid Microsoft $300/yr for a code-signing cert yet. Click **More info → Run anyway**. It's safe — I built this myself, in front of y'all.
>
> Made with vibe coding (Tauri + React + Rust). Ask me anything in the comments — I'll show how it's built in the next live.
>
> **Use this for personal and educational purposes only. Respect creators. Don't redistribute downloads. Don't drop downloaded content into client work or paid projects without rights. You are responsible for your own use of the tool.**

## 2. Install guide (paste under the post or as a comment)

> **Two install paths below. Pick the one that matches your vibe.**
>
> **Path A — "Just install it"**: double-click an installer, done. Skip to *Quick install*.
>
> **Path B — "Vibe coder install"**: have your AI (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, whatever you're rolling with) read the repo, confirm the code is safe, and walk you through it. Builds the muscle of verifying open-source software with AI before you run it.

### Path B — Vibe coder install (recommended for the community)

This is the install path I actually want y'all to use, because it's the same move you should make for ANY open source software a stranger on the internet hands you. **Including from me.** Don't trust — verify.

1. Open your AI dev environment (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, whichever).
2. Paste this prompt:

```
Look at this repo: https://github.com/jackdog668/da-video-tool

Read the README, the LICENSE, the package.json, src/App.tsx,
src-tauri/src/lib.rs, src-tauri/Cargo.toml, src-tauri/tauri.conf.json,
and scripts/fetch-binaries.ps1.

Tell me:
1. What does this app actually do?
2. Is the code safe to run? Any red flags (data exfiltration, network
   calls to weird servers, anything that touches files outside what
   you'd expect for a video downloader)?
3. What external binaries does it bundle and where do they come from?
4. Walk me through downloading the latest release installer from
   https://github.com/jackdog668/da-video-tool/releases/latest
   and installing it on Windows. Include the SmartScreen step.
```

3. Read your AI's answer. It should tell you the app uses `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` as bundled sidecars, makes no external network calls of its own (the Rust shell only talks to those two local executables), and writes only to the folder you pick. If your AI flags anything sketchy — **don't run it, message me, I want to know.**
4. Once your AI clears it, follow its install walkthrough.

That's the whole methodology of vibe coding in 5 minutes — your AI is your security partner, not just your build partner.

### Path A — Quick install

1. Click the `Video Lab_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` file attached to this post
2. Save it somewhere (Downloads is fine)
3. Double-click the `.msi`
4. If Windows says **"Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"** → click **More info** → **Run anyway**
5. The installer runs. Click through (default options are fine).
6. Find **DA Video Tool** in your Start menu or Desktop, open it.

### First download

1. Copy any YouTube / TikTok / Vimeo / X link to your clipboard
2. Click **paste** in the app (or Ctrl+V into the URL field)
3. Pick where you want the file saved (the app remembers next time)
4. Hit **Download**
5. When it's done, click **open file** to play it instantly

### Pro moves

- **Playlist mode:** paste a YouTube playlist URL → check off which videos you want → bulk download
- **Audio only:** switch format to `Audio MP3` → great for ripping music, podcasts, voiceovers
- **Subtitles toggle:** purple pill button — gets subs as a separate `.srt` file AND embedded in the MP4
- **Thumbnail toggle:** gold pill — embeds the poster image into the MP4

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "SmartScreen prevented..." | Click **More info → Run anyway**. The app's not malware, just unsigned. |
| Download fails on a YouTube video | The bundled yt-dlp gets stale every few months. v0.4 will auto-update; for now, message me and I'll drop a new build. |
| Audio missing on playback | Make sure you're on v0.1.0+ — the codec fix is baked in. |
| Antivirus flags `yt-dlp.exe` | False positive (super common). Whitelist the app folder or check VirusTotal yourself. |

## 3. Where to find the installer

Hosted on **GitHub Releases** — Skool's free-tier file cap is ~30MB so we host externally and link from the post.

**Direct download (paste this into the Skool post as the install button link):**

```
https://github.com/jackdog668/da-video-tool/releases/download/v0.1.0/Video%20Lab_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe
```

**Release page (paste in the body so members can see what's new):**

```
https://github.com/jackdog668/da-video-tool/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```

### Verify your download (optional, for the paranoid)

After downloading, open PowerShell where the file is and run:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\"Video Lab_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe"
```

You should see:

```
224CDF7B141F45A67B80E612F235B51A255D259399AD8AF6C219AA22313A3153
```

If the hash matches, the file you downloaded is byte-for-byte the one I built. If it doesn't — don't run it, message me.

### Local build paths (for me, not members)

```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Video Lab_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe   ← shipped to Release (62MB)
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Video Lab_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi    ← MSI alternative (86MB, optional)
```

- [ ] yt-dlp self-update button
- [ ] Cookie support for sites needing login (Patreon, X private, etc.)
- [ ] Custom output filename templates
- [ ] Cancel/retry buttons per job
- [ ] Built-in trim / clip tool
